    "#This notebook contains a sort of hybrid between C++ and cuppa. As yacc is all I am familiar with,\n",
    "#I used yacc for this project. I did attempt to use other parsers briefly, but had trouble with implementation.\n",
    "#I have a particular love for C, and thought the challenge would be fun.\n",
    "#The implementation was not very successful. I hit multiple roadblocks with syntax errors in the parser.\n",
    "#I restarted several times over a couple weeks before finally using cuppa 5 as a template. \n",
    "#I thought of my language as an optimized version of C++, keeping the best features and discarding the rest.\n",
    "#I didn't quite reach the goal, but if I had then I think I would prefer my language to C or Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#In the end I made more of a hybrid between cuppa5 and C++ as I opted to leave out specific features I didn't like.\n",
    "#One of the primary aspects of the C language that I intentionally left out was the LL1 requirement.\n",
    "#A typical C program runs through function declarations, main, then function bodies. \n",
    "#The lR1 parser reads the function bodies first, then the main program, then the function declarations.\n",
    "#It seemed like a waste to create a language that was restricted to declarations and a main function.\n",
    "#The grammar would have been relatively simple to adjust, I would have only needed to change a few things. \n",
    "#First, the grammar rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "#    program : stmt_list\n",
    "#    stmt_list : stmt stmt_list\n",
    "#              | empty\n",
    "#    stmt : VOID_TYPE ID '(' opt_formal_args ')' stmt\n",
    "#         | data_type ID '(' opt_formal_args ')' stmt\n",
    "#         | data_type ID opt_init ';'\n",
    "\n",
    "#Would change to :\n",
    "\n",
    "#    program : declaration\n",
    "#    declaration : VOID_TYPE ID '(' opt_formal_args ')' ';' declaration\n",
    "#                | data_type ID '(' opt_formal_args ')' ';' declaration\n",
    "#                | data_type ID opt_init ';' declaration\n",
    "#                | INTEGER_TYPE MAIN '(' opt_formal_args ')' '{' stmt_list '}' opt_func\n",
    "#    opt_func : VOID_TYPE ID '(' opt_formal_args ')' stmt\n",
    "#             | data_type ID '(' opt_formal_args ')' stmt\n",
    "#    stmt : data_type ID opt_init ';'\n",
    "#    ...\n",
    "#    opt_func : VOID_TYPE ID '(' opt_formal_args ')' stmt opt_func\n",

    "#             | empty\n",
    "\n",
    "#Second, interp_walk would include a pre-pass that checked to make sure all function declarations \n",
    "#had a matching function body after the main program. It would move those function bodies up to the start\n",
    "#of the AST in place of the declarations. Then it would switch the main args to variable declarations and\n",
    "#treat the main function as a block statement. Once done, the actual interp_walk would just read the bodies \n",
    "#and establish them at a global scope. Overall it was very easy to implemetnt, just tedious, so I thought I would handle\n",
    "#two more difficult challenges instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The big issue I faced is the combination of references and increment/decrement operators. This is where I really ran into\n",
    "#trouble and why I had to restart multiple times. I didn't realize the impacts each change I made had on the rest of the\n",
    "#program. I kept making several changes at a time to grammar, frontend, and lex. I would reach a similar point to where I\n",
    "#had reached before, try to add a few new rules, and cause a parser error that I didn't understand.\n",
    "#It took me a long time, but I eventually learned from my mistake. I added pre-increment, pre-decrement, post increment,\n",
    "#and post-decrement to my compiler one rule at a time. I had to include a new rule called an operable to keep the\n",
    "#prefixes and postfixes separate from the actual storable variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Post decrement and increment both were incredibly harder to instantiate than I thought. They required adding new return\n",
    "#variables but only to specific tuples. Any statement besides a function declaration can contain a suffix, so they had to be\n",
    "#added throughout the program. Additionally, I had to create a function to analyze the suffix return value because multiple\n",
    "#storables can be in the same statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#My architecture contains char, integer, double, and string value types. Each type can be an array type or a function type.\n",
    "#I never ended up finishing the addition of pointers to my language. They are present in the grammar, frontend, and interp_walk.\n",
    "#However, I spent all of my time trying ot figure out the pre/post inc/dec operators and never added the pointer heirarchy \n",
    "#to the symbol table or type promotion. Because of this my program is in a strange state where it can accept pointers\n",
    "#but it ignores them. However, something finally clicked at the very end that allowed me to finish the suffix operators. \n",
    "#With another day I have no doubt I would have the pointers finished.\n",
    "\n",
