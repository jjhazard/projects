Collaboration:
* We did not receive help outside of the assignment specification. We did not collaborate with other teams. 


Correctly implemented:
* UArray2b_T: an unboxed 2D array structure with blocking.
* A2plain.c: provides a method suite as described by the a2methods.h interface.
* Ppmtrans: a program that performs image transformations on ppm files from std input.
* Compile script.
Incorrectly implemented:
* Printing the new image array. 


Documents the architecture of your solutions.
* ppmtrans.c 
* a2methods.h 
* a2blocked.h         a2blocked.c
* a2plain.h                 a2plain.c
* uarray2b.h         uarray2b.c
* uarray2.h                 uarray2.c
* compile
